# Ansible Role: Drush

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/geerlingguy/ansible-role-drush.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/geerlingguy/ansible-role-drush)

Installs [Drush](http://www.drush.org/en/master/), a command line shell and scripting interface for Drupal, on any Linux or UNIX system.

## Git module catch

In versions of Ansible affected by https://github.com/ansible/ansible-modules-core/issues/426 (at least 1.8.{1,2}), the role will fail with drush\_keep\_updated: no (the default). Set it to yes if you need it work with affected Ansible versions.

## Requirements

PHP must be installed on the system prior to running this role (suggested role: `geerlingguy.php`).

Source installation additionally requires Git and Composer to also be installed on the system (suggested roles: `geerlingguy.git` and `geerlingguy.composer`).

## Role Variables

Available variables are listed below, along with default values (see `defaults/main.yml`):

    drush_phar_url: https://github.com/drush-ops/drush/releases/download/8.1.10/drush.phar

The URL from which the Drush phar file will be downloaded.

    drush_path: /usr/local/bin/drush

The path where drush will be installed and available to your system. Should be in your user's `$PATH` so you can run commands simply with `drush` instead of the full path.

    drush_config: ~/.drush

Path to the directory where Drush will store its generated config.

    drush_install_from_source: no

Whether to use Git and Composer to install Drush from source.

    drush_version: 8.1.10

The version of Drush to download (examples: `8.1.10`, `8.1.9`). This should exactly match an available [Drush release](https://github.com/drush-ops/drush/releases). Note that setting `drush_install_from_source` to `yes` changes the possible values for `drush_version`--see below for more information.

### Variables used for source install (Git).

    drush_install_path: /usr/local/share/drush

The location of the entire drush installation (includes all the supporting files, as well as the `drush` executable file.

    drush_version: "master"

The version of Drush to install (examples: `"master"` for the bleeding edge, `"7.x"`, `"6.x"`, `"6.2.0"`). This should be a string as it refers to a git branch, tag, or commit hash.

    drush_keep_updated: no
    drush_force_update: no

Whether to keep Drush up-to-date with the latest revision of the branch specified by `drush_version`, and whether to force the update (e.g. overwrite local modifications to the drush repository).

    drush_force_composer_install: no

Use this if you get an error message when provisioning like `Unable to load autoload.php. Run composer install to fetch dependencies and write this file`. It will force a `composer install` inside the Drush directory.

    drush_composer_cli_options: "--prefer-source --no-interaction"

These options are the safest for avoiding GitHub API rate limits when installing Drush, and can be very helpful when working on dependencies/installation, but builds can be sped up substantially by changing the first option to --prefer-dist.

    drush_clone_depth: 1

Whether to clone the entire repo (by default), or specify the number of previous commits for a smaller and faster clone.

## Dependencies

None.

## Example Playbook

    - hosts: servers
      roles:
        - geerlingguy.drush

After the playbook runs, the `drush` command will be accessible from normal system accounts.
